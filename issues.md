# Architecture Catalogs Development Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop comprehensive architecture catalogs for the Public Transportation Information System following the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM). A catalog is a fundamental type of artifact in architecture design that provides structured lists of architectural objects, serving as the foundation for informed decision-making throughout the enterprise architecture development process.

## Project Objectives

- **Establish Architecture Foundation**: Create standardized catalogs that serve as authoritative sources of architectural information
- **Enable Informed Decision-Making**: Provide structured data to support architecture governance and strategic planning
- **Support TOGAF ADM Implementation**: Develop artifacts aligned with each phase of the Architecture Development Method
- **Facilitate Stakeholder Communication**: Create clear, accessible documentation of system components and relationships
- **Enable Future Expansion**: Establish extensible frameworks for ongoing catalog development and maintenance

## TOGAF ADM Catalog Mapping

> The purpose of the Principles catalog is to capture the key principles that will inform and guide how the organization fulfills its mission through IT. Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission. These principles will be based on an organization's values, and will guide the organization in its use of IT. The Principles catalog provides a foundation for decision-making throughout the enterprise and a basis for architecture governance. The Principles catalog contains the following metamodel entities: Principle.

## Data structure

Each principle entry contains the following fields:

- **id**: Unique identifier following pattern `principles:XXX` (3 digits)
- **domain**: The architectural domain (e.g., "Software Architecture", "Data Architecture", "Technology Architecture")
- **name**: The principle name (e.g., "Separation of Concerns")
- **description**: Clear statement of what the principle requires
- **rationale**: Why this principle is important and beneficial
- **implications**: What this principle means for implementation and decision-making

## Definition according to TOGAF

> The purpose of the Stakeholder catalog is to identify the stakeholders for the architecture engagement, their influence over the engagement, and their key questions, issues, or concerns that must be addressed by the architecture framework. The Stakeholder catalog is referenced in creating a stakeholder map, showing which stakeholders are involved with a specific aspect of the Enterprise Architecture, their level of involvement, and their key concerns. Understanding stakeholders and their requirements allows an architect to focus effort in areas that meet the needs of stakeholders (see the TOGAF Standard â€” ADM Techniques). Due to the potentially sensitive nature of stakeholder mapping information and the fact that the Architecture Vision phase is intended to be conducted using informal modeling techniques, no specific metamodel entities will be used to generate a Stakeholder catalog.

## Data structure

Each stakeholder entry contains the following fields:

- **id**: Unique identifier following pattern `stakeholder:XXX` (3 digits)

## Current catalog content

The catalog currently contains key stakeholders for the public transportation system:

- **stakeholder:001** - Passengers (End Users)

# Interface Catalog

File: `architecture/catalogs/interface.yaml`

## Description according to TOGAF

> The purpose of the Interface catalog is to scope and document the interfaces between applications to enable the overall dependencies between applications to be scoped as early as possible.

## Requirements traceability

The catalog establishes traceability links between requirements and other architectural elements:

- **Components**: Maps requirements to implementing system components
- **Interfaces**: Links requirements to supporting system interfaces
- **Data Entities**: Connects requirements to relevant data structures
- **Actors**: Associates requirements with interacting users and systems
- **Stakeholders**: Traces requirements to originating stakeholder needs
