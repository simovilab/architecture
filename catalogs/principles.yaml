# List of architectural principles
principles:
  - id: "principles:001"
    domain: "Software Architecture"
    name: "Separation of Concerns"
    description: "Different concerns should be separated into distinct sections of the system to improve maintainability and scalability."
    rationale: "By separating concerns, we can reduce complexity and make it easier to manage changes."
    implications: "Modules should have clear responsibilities and interfaces."
    related_principles: []

      - "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"

  - id: "principles:002"
    domain: "Software Architecture"
    name: "Single Responsibility Principle"
    description: "A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change."
    rationale: "This principle helps in reducing the impact of changes and improves code readability."
    implications: "Classes should be designed to handle a single functionality."

  - id: "principles:003"
    domain: "Software Architecture"
    name: "Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)"
    description: "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
    rationale: "Avoiding duplication reduces the risk of inconsistencies and makes maintenance easier."
    implications: "Code should be modular and reusable."
